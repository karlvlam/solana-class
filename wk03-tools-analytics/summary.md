## Transaction Analytics

I tried to understand how sharky.fi level up (upgrade) their Sharx NFT.

It seems that they just send the Fishy token to a burn account, and it will call a program to update the NFT metadata. The "upgrade" is just a value/graphic change of the metadata. 

## Fishy analytics using Dune.com

Dune dashboard: https://dune.com/karlvlam/fishy-93c19

Mainly clone from https://dune.com/wagg/bonk-stats . Then convert to Dune SQL

It is complicated, I added a graph about the daily Sharx upgrade.

Still cannot figure out how to query complex data structure such as pre/post_balance. This part is not completed.
